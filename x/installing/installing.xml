  <title>X Window System Environment</title>

  <para>This chapter contains instructions to build and configure a graphical
  user environment. You will need to choose one of the three packages in BLFS
  that implements the <application>X Window System</application>:
  <application>Xorg</application> X11R6 or X11R7 (<xref linkend="xorg"/> or
  <xref linkend="xorg7"/>), or <application>XFree86</application>
  (<xref linkend="xfree86"/>). These packages are all quite similar. In fact,
  the base system of <application>Xorg</application> is
  <application>XFree86</application>-4.4.0RC2. Differences in the licensing
  philosophies was the original reason for the split.</para>

  <para>A second reason for the forking of <application>X</application>
  packages is the stated goals of the developers. Some developers were unhappy
  with the administration and progress of <application>XFree86</application>.
  The X.org Foundation's future plans include significant improvements to the
  internals of the system and more frequent releases.</para>

  <para><application>Xorg</application>-&xorg7-version; introduces a completely
  autotooled build system, but is otherwise the same codebase as
  <application>Xorg</application>-&xorg-version;. Most large commercial
  distributions have decided to use the <application>Xorg</application>
  package, but several still provide <application>XFree86</application>.</para>

  <para><application>XFree86</application> continues to be a solid,
  conservative application with excellent driver support.</para>
