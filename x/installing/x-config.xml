  <para>Below you will find information on fine tuning the components of both
  variants of <application>X Window System</application>. The documentation
  links are specifically for <application>XFree86</application>, however, the
  information contained in those documents usually pertains to
  <application>Xorg</application> as well.</para>

      <title>Mice</title>

      <para>Multi-button mice can be used to their full potential by mapping
      the additional buttons to X button events. Wheel mice are a common example.
      The ordinary ones contain two buttons, and a scroll wheel that doubles as
      a third button.  As far as <application>X</application> is concerned, there
      are 5 buttons as it counts the 'scroll up' and 'scroll down' functions
      (internally they are buttons). Here is an example 'InputDevice' section for
      a typical PS/2 wheel mouse:</para>

<screen><literal>Section "InputDevice"
  Identifier  "Mouse 0"
  Driver      "mouse"
  Option      "Device"        "/dev/input/mice"
  Option      "Protocol"      "IMPS/2"
  Option      "ZAxisMapping"  "4 5"
  Option      "Buttons"       "5"
EndSection</literal></screen>

      <para>Button assignments differ for every mouse type. On more exotic
      mice, you may find that the rocker wheel buttons are 6 and 7. Simply
      add those values to the <option>ZAxisMapping</option> option, and set
      the <option>Buttons</option> option appropriately to enable side to
      side scrolling. Additional information on button assignment can be
      found in the following <application>XFree86</application>
      document:</para>
