  </indexterm>

  <para>The <filename>ca-bundle.crt</filename> file contains public
  certificates from trusted root certificate authorities (CAs).  CAs guarantee
  the authenticity of a host by issuing certificates that contain both the name
  of the host and the owner's name, and are signed using the CA's private key.
  In turn, a matching public key is provided by the CA that can be used to
  verify the authenticity of any SSL certificate that is signed by that CA. The
  list of CA certificates (with public keys) included in ca-bundle.crt
  are provided by mozilla.org, and undergo an annual investigation and
  auditing process, so that they can be trusted for general use.</para>

  <para>The list of certificates is stored in PEM format, and is generated from
  a DER formatted file, <filename>certdata.txt</filename>, that ships with
  Mozilla products. A <ulink
  url="http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/ca-certificates/devel/mkcabundle.pl?view=co">
  script</ulink> provided by RedHat converts the upstream
  <filename>certdata.txt</filename> from DER to PEM format, so that it is
  usable by applications that utilize SSL/TLS encryption.  Additional trusted
  CAs can be added to the <filename>ca-bundle.crt</filename> by appending the
  CA's public certificate (in PEM format) to the file.</para>

  <para>Download a recent version of <ulink
  url="&files-anduin;/ca-bundle.crt">ca-bundle.crt</ulink> and place it into
  the <filename class="directory">/etc/ssl</filename> directory and make
  the file world readable by issuing the following commands as the 
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>install -v -d /etc/ssl &amp;&amp;
install -m644 ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl</userinput></screen>
